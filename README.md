# Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge

## Goal
Product pricing gets even harder at scale, considering just how many products are sold online. Clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.

Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace.

We will build a system that automatically suggests the right product prices. We are provided with user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.
